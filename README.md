# Navin Frontend

**Navin** is a blockchain-powered logistics platform that improves supply chain visibility for enterprises through tokenized shipments, immutable milestone tracking, and automated settlements.
By creating a zero-trust interface between logistics providers and their clients, Navin ensures both parties access identical real-time data — removing information asymmetry and enabling seamless, dispute-free operations.

This repository is the **frontend** of the Navin platform — a React application that gives logistics companies and their customers a single, real-time interface to track shipments, verify on-chain milestones, and monitor automated payment settlements.

## What the Frontend Does

| Feature | Description |

| **Automated Settlement Tracking** | Payment status updated automatically when verified delivery events occur on-chain |
| **Company Dashboard** | Logistics companies manage shipments, users, and track performance analytics |
| **Customer Dashboard** | Customers track their active shipments and delivery history in one place |
| **Shipment Detail View** | Full breakdown of a single shipment — milestones, IoT sensor data, payment status, and delivery proof |
