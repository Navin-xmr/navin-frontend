. Visual Identity & ThemePalette: Deep blues ($#0F172A$ / $#1E293B$ range) with vibrant accents: Blue (Primary/Action), Green (Success/Delivered), Orange (Pending/Delayed), and Purple (Secondary actions).Typography: Clean, sans-serif typeface (likely Inter or similar) focused on legibility of data strings like blockchain hashes and shipment IDs.2.

Functional HighlightsBlockchain Integration: The Desktop view features a "Blockchain Ledger" menu item and "Verify" buttons that likely link to on-chain transactions. It even shows a "Syncing: Block 18.2M" status for an Enterprise Node.Contextual Actions: * Desktop: Focuses on management (Generate Settlements, Track Tokens).Tablet: Focuses on operations (Assign Driver, Print Labels).Mobile: Focuses on quick access (QR Scanner for scanning packages on the go).Network Visualization: The Desktop version includes a "Network Distribution" world map showing active node locations ($n=142$).Observations for ImprovementData Consistency: Note that the data varies significantly between the mockups (e.g., Desktop shows 1,248 total shipments, while Tablet shows 1,284 active shipments). If these are for a presentation, you may want to align these numbers.Empty States: Consider how the "Recent Shipments" section looks when no data is available, especially on the mobile view where space is premium.
