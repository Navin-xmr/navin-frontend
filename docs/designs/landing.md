# Landing Page Design

This document summarizes the changes made for the public landing page and provides a guide for implementing the mockup.

The work includes creating a complete mockup that represents a public facing landing page with the following key sections:

- **Hero section**: prominent headline and a clear call-to-action (CTA) button
- **Features grid**: 4–6 feature cards, each with an icon, title and brief description
- **How it works**
- **Why Navin?**
- **Footer**: containing navigation links and possibly contact or legal info

The design was created in Figma and can be viewed here:
